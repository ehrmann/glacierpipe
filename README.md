# glacierpipe

glacierpipe is a command line tool for piping data from ```stdin``` to an archive on [Amazon Glacier](http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/â€Ž), generally as part of a
backup process where storing the file on disk prior to uploading is undesirable. 

Its arguments are compatible with [MoriTanosuke's glacieruploader](https://github.com/MoriTanosuke/glacieruploader/).

## Typical use

```
tar -c <directory> | \
xz | \
java ... glacierpipe.GlacierPipeMain \
    --upload \
    --endpoint us-east-1 \
    --partsize 33554432 \
    --vault <vault name> \
    <archive name>.tar.xz
```

e.g.

```
$ tar -c /home | xz | java -jar glacierpipe.jar \
    --upload \
    -e us-east-1 \
    -p 8388608 \
    -v home-backups \
    home.tar.xz

## Building
```
$ ant
```

This will create ```./dist/glacierpipe.jar```.

## Running
glacierpipe is packaged with [One-JAR](http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/), so it can be run with the `-jar` option, avoiding classpath and dependency issues.

### Credentials
Credentials are stored in ```${user.home}/aws.properties``` by default in the following format:

```
accessKey=your_aws_access_key
secretKey=your_secret_key
```

### Command line options
```
    --credentials <arg>                     path to your aws credentials
                                            file (default:
                                            $HOME/aws.properties)
 -e,--endpoint <arg>                        URL of the amazon AWS endpoint
                                            where your vault is
    --help                                  show help
    --max-upload-rate <[Bps | automatic]>   the maximum upload rate
 -p,--partsize <bytes>                      the size of each part for
                                            multipart uploads.  Must be a
                                            power of 2 between (inclusive)
                                            1MB and 4GB (default: 16MB)
 -r,--max-retries <count>                   the maximum number of times to
                                            retry uploading a chunk
 -u,--upload                                upload stdin to glacier
 -v,--vault <arg>                           Name of your vault
```

## Internals
Entire parts are read from ```stdin```, buffered in memory, and a [SHA-256 tree hash](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html) computed on them prior to
upload.  In the event a part fails to upload, since the part was buffered in memory, uploading just that part is
reattempted.
